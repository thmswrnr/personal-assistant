# Code review

Review code changes with a structured lens on security, performance, correctness, and maintainability.

Review the code changes the user points to — a diff, a PR URL (fetch it with `gh pr diff`), or a file path. If nothing specific is provided, ask what to review.

## How It Works

```

│  STANDALONE (always works)                                       │
│  ✓ Paste a diff, PR URL, or point to files                      │
│  ✓ Security audit (OWASP top 10, injection, auth)               │
│  ✓ Performance review (N+1, memory leaks, complexity)           │
│  ✓ Correctness (edge cases, error handling, race conditions)    │
│  ✓ Style (naming, structure, readability)                        │
│  ✓ Actionable suggestions with code examples                    │

## Review Dimensions

### Security
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Insecure deserialization
- Path traversal
- SSRF

### Performance
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary memory allocations
- Algorithmic complexity (O(n²) in hot paths)
- Missing database indexes
- Unbounded queries or loops
- Resource leaks

### Correctness
- Edge cases (empty input, null, overflow)
- Race conditions and concurrency issues
- Error handling and propagation
- Off-by-one errors
- Type safety

### Maintainability
- Naming clarity
- Single responsibility
- Duplication
- Test coverage
- Documentation for non-obvious logic

## Using Core's tools

- **Source control** — pull the PR diff with `gh pr diff <url>` (or `git diff`), and verify the change addresses its stated requirements.
- **Tasks** (`tasks` skill) — link findings to related Google Tasks items, or open a task for follow-up fixes.
- **Knowledge base** (`remember` skill / `artefacts/`) — check the change against any coding standards or notes saved in the second brain.

## Tips

1. **Provide context** — "This is a hot path" or "This handles PII" helps me focus.
2. **Specify concerns** — "Focus on security" narrows the review.
3. **Include tests** — I'll check test coverage and quality too.
